# Dynamic Array Sum in C++

This project demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation in C++ by creating a program that:
- Dynamically allocates an array of integers based on user input.
- Fills the array with user-provided values using a `while` loop.
- Calculates and outputs the sum of the array elements using a `while` loop.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components:
1. **Header File (`ArrayOperations.h`)**: Contains the declarations of the functions used for dynamic array operations.
2. **Source File (`ArrayOperations.cpp`)**: Implements the functions declared in the header file.
3. **Main File (`main.cpp`)**: Contains the `main` function where the user interacts with the program.

### Files

- `ArrayOperations.hpp` - Contains function declarations.
- `ArrayOperations.cpp` - Defines functions to create, input, and sum the array.
- `main.cpp` - Runs the program logic.
- `README.md` - Provides an overview of the project.
